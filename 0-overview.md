# Data Structures Tutorial
## I. Welcome
Welcome to learning about data structures! Data structures allow us programmers to create more efficient solutions to different coding problems. Sometimes the straightforward approach to a problem, while logically makes sense, could cause your program to take significantly longer to run when we are processing huge chunks of data. 

Just think if we needed to find a needle in a haystack, this could take forever searching by hand! If we give the problem an extra second of thought we could take a magnet to the haystack and find our needle in a snap. In the same way, if we take an extra moment to consider data structures, we could find significantly faster solutions to a number of problems.
